# const_matrices
This Repository is an implementation of matrices and vectors using compile time constant generics in Rust.

It is a work in progress

## Supports

* Generics over Algebraic Types
* Matrix creation
* Matrix-Matrix Operations
* Matrix-Scalar Operations
* Matrix-Vector Operations
* Vector Creation
* Vector-Scalar Operations
* Vector-Vector Operations
* Matrix and Vector Iterators
* Special Types for common matrices

## TODO:

1. Row Reduction Algorithms
2. Traits for symmetric and other matrix types
   * Optimization purposes
3. LU & QR Decomposition
4. More BLAS support
5. Matrix Inverses
6. Eigenvalue Algorithms
7. Householder Transformations and other efficient algorithms
8. Better Benchmarking
9. Better Doctests
10. Tensors??
